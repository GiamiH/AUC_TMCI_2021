    "> Remember that this is a code notebook - add an explanation of what you do using text boxes and markdown, and comment your code.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you re-use a substantial portion of code you find online, e.g on Stackoverflow, you need to add a link to it and make the borrowing explicit. The same applies of you take it and modify it, even substantially. There is nothing bad in doing that, providing you are acknowledging it and make it clear you know what you're doing. Similarly, if you make use of generative language models (e.g. ChatGPT) to draft your answer, you must acknowledge this and include the prompts used to obtain that output. Again, your answer should be sufficiently commented and described to show that you understand your code.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Make sure your notebooks have been run when you submit, as I won't run them myself. Submit both the `.ipynb` file along with an `.html` export of the same. Submit all necessary auxilliary files as well. Please compress your submission into a `.zip` archive. Only `.zip` files can be submitted.\n",
    "> If you are using Google Colab, here is a tutorial for obtaining an HTML export: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53460051/convert-ipynb-notebook-to-html-in-google-colab .\n",

    "> As follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 70 points for correctly completing the assignment.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 20 points for appropriately writing and organizing your code in terms of structure, readibility (also by humans), comments and minimal documentation. It is important to be concise but also to explain what you did and why, when not obvious. Feel free to re-use functions and variables from previous questions if that helps for structure and readability - you do not need to repeat previous steps for each question.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * 10 points for doing something extra, e.g., if you go beyond expectations (overall or on something specific). Some ideas for extras might be mentioned in the exercises, or you can come up with your own. You don't need to do them all to get the bonus. The sum of points is 90, doing (some of) the extras can bring you to 100, so the extras are not necessary to get an A.\n",

    "In the `data/numan` directory, there are lyrics of some songs from two albums by electronic music pioneer Gary Numan. There are 5 songs from his 1979 album and 5 songs from his 2017 album.  This data was acquired from [Genius](https://genius.com) (Genius Lyrics) using their API, something that you could do too using the lyricsgenius package for Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the data from these files into an appropriate data structure and perform appropriate preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: This might be a good opportunity to show how good you were at writing re-usable code in the previous questions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function that can return some statistics about an albums' song lyrics, and run this function for both albums:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Most frequent words\n",
    "    * Type to token ratio (unique words/words)\n",
    "    * Average word length\n",
    "    * Longest and shortests songs (by lyrics)\n",
    "    * What are the songs with the largest vocabulary and smallest vocabulary?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Print these results to your notebook for both albums in a nice looking way. Then, also show these same statistics for just the song 'Cars' from the 1979 album, which was Gary Numan's most famous song.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Write down your interpretation of these results in this notebook.  \n",
    "   * In which of the two time periods was Gary Numan more verbose? Back it with some evidence.\n",
    "   * Electronic music is sometimes said to make more use of repetition than other forms of music. In which of the two time periods did Gary Numan make more use of lyrical repetition? You can either argue your case based on the numbers you were asked to calculate, or you can come up with your own definition of 'repetitiveness' and calculate it with Python code."
