    "> If you re-use a substantial portion of code you find online, e.g on Stackoverflow, you need to add a link to it and make the borrowing explicit. The same applies of you take it and modify it, even substantially. There is nothing bad in doing that, providing you are acknowledging it and make it clear you know what you're doing. Similarly, if you make use of generative language models (e.g. ChatGPT) to draft your answer, you must acknowledge this and include the prompts used to obtain that output. Again, your answer should be sufficiently commented and described to show that you understand your code.\n",

    ">The code defines a function to calculate the frequency of words that share the same starting and ending characters. The input is the file path so that it can also be used for other text files. First, the function opens the file, and replaces hypens and line breaks with spaces to avoid broken words and remove hyphens that are not part of the word (e.g.: —Thomas). The text is then tokenize into words which I used chatGPT to help with not including numbers (e.g.: 22). I tried previously with `r'\\b\\D+\\b'` because I thought it will omit digit characters but it resulted for the whole text to be returned rather than the word frequency. The words are then filtered in a loop that makes sure it is more than two characters, and that the first and last characters are the same. The words that meet the criteria are counted by `Counter()` and the function `frequency_same_character` returns the word frequency. In the final output, a loop is employed to print each word along with its corresponding frequency."

The first pareto chart is plotted by creating the bar plot for the causes, and a line plot for the cumulative frequency.The alternative version is \"inspired\" by a model I saw on Wikipedia which shows usages of two y-axis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart). The difference is it initializes `cumulative_frequencies` with 56 rather than 0 because the cumulative frequency starts at 56 and not 0.

    "> The function takes a text and tokenizes the text into words using a regular expression and filters out words that are not alphabetic or have less than 4 characters. I chose the RegexpTokenizer (https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer.html) because it is customizable hence is more straightforward for me and easier to fix if I want to change something based on past exercises. The function then removes stopwords using NLTK's predefined list and returns the preprocessed list of tokens. The function `word_frequencies()` creates a frequency distribution of the input tokens using NLTK's FreqDist, sorts the frequency distribution based on descending frequency order, and returns a list of tuples containing words and their corresponding frequencies. The `create_csv()` writes the sorted word frequencies to a CSV file. The final output is by opening the text file and calling for the functions to tokenize, sort, and create a file `Alice_word_frequencies.csv` of sorted word frequencies by descending order. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Comments: there are some stopwords (names, \"little\", etc.) with high frequency which suggests that the NLTK library's default stopwords are not up to date or inclusive of these words. My choice of tokenizer can be limiting to words with hyphens or non-alphabetic characters. This can be improved by trying out different tokenizers or setting different/more expressions to have better results. \n",

ChatGPT helped with making the function `load_lyrics()` as it showed me how to do it for future cases and I worked on the rest. The first function initializes an empty dictionary to store the lyrics, and then it goes through a loop to check if the entry is a directory. Followed with another iteration through each song file to check if it is a text file, and then it reads the lyrics from each file and store it in the empty dictionary made prior and is then returned as `data`. The following are functions made to proprocess the texts, calculate the frequency, formatting, and printing the results.\n",

    "> Comment: the 1979 album has a higher type-to-token ratio (0.35) compared to the 2017 album (0.23) which suggests that a higher diversity of words relative to the total number of word hence less repetitive words. This implies that Gary Numan was more verbose in the earlier 1979 album than 2017. In terms of lyrical repetition, based on the most frequent words of each album, the 2017 album has a higher number of repetition and it has a lower type-to-token ratio which suggests that it has lower diversity of words hence more repetitions.
